### Week 3: Designing a Fully Responsive, User-Friendly Form

#### üöÄ Project Objective
During Week 3 of my internship at Vaultofcodes, I embarked on a mission to create a fully responsive, user-friendly form. The goal was to ensure that the form adapts seamlessly to various devices, providing an intuitive and pleasant user experience.

This project was an exciting opportunity to delve into the intricacies of HTML, enhancing my skills and applying them to a practical, real-world project. By incorporating responsive design principles, I aimed to ensure that the form is visually appealing and functional across different screen sizes and orientations.

#### üé® Project Highlights
